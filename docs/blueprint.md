## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) for a fresh, trustworthy feel, representing the clear and concise nature of the facts presented.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), offering a neutral backdrop that ensures readability and minimizes distraction from both the facts and advertisements.
- Accent color: Soft green (#98FB98) to highlight interactive elements like the 'Next Fact' button and navigation links, providing a subtle, inviting prompt for user action.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for page titles, like the fixed header "SVKFACTS", conveying sophistication; body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, to maximize readability in the presentation of facts.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any code snippets that might appear.
- Implement a responsive layout ensuring facts and ads are neatly arranged across different screen sizes. The facts and navigation button will take up approximately one-fourth of the screen space, with ads taking up the rest.
- Subtle fade-in animations when loading new facts to enhance the user experience without causing distractions.
